1.Tables:

Table-S1_Parental traning dataset: We compiled modern arc and non-arc basalts from the GEOROC and PetDB databases.

Table-S2_Training dataset for XGBoost modeling: WThe major and trace elements were extracted from the "Parental training dataset", which can be applied to train the XGBoost machine learning model.

Table-S3_Parental application dataset: The application dataset comprises global basalts (~0.85 Ga to the present).

Table-S4_Application dataset for prediction: We extracted major and trace elements from the "Parental application dataset", which can be predicted by the trained XGBoost model.

Table-S5_Calculated melting PT of primitive arc basalts: We calculated the meting pressure and temperature conditions of global primitive arc basalts.

Table-S6_Petrological modeling for arc mantle melts: We applied the partial melting model to eatimate the sub-arc mantle fO2 (see Methods in the main text).

Table-S7_Calculated mean V-Sc and PT of primitive arc basalts: The estimated mean V/Sc ratios and melting pressure and temperature conditions of primtive arc basalts since ~0.8 Ga.

Reference key for application dataset: References information for application dataset.

2.Code
Please put the Excel file and the python code in the same path. All the python codes were implemented on the Jupyter Notebook platform.

If you want to run the "Python_arc_classification ML model_ctliu20243", you can use the Excel Table-S2 and Table-S4. See details in the python file.
